This project presents a complete machine learning pipeline for classifying wine types using the Wine dataset from Scikit-learn. It includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and a thorough comparison of 11 classification models. Each model is tuned using GridSearchCV, and performance is evaluated using multiple metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. The project also includes rich visualizations such as correlation heatmaps, confusion matrices, and learning curves, offering a clear and interpretable view of model behavior. This end-to-end implementation demonstrates practical skills in data science, model selection, evaluation, and visualization.
